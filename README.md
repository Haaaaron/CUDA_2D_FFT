# Two Dimensional FFT with CUDA

All of the simulations are built around a Phase Field Crystal model, nonetheless the main focus is the 2D Fast Fourier Transform 

## [FFTW+MPI](./FFTW_MPI_PFC_Model)

Phase Field Crystal model paralellised with MPI

## [Serial CUDA FFT](./CUDA_Serial)

Serial version of CUDA FFT
